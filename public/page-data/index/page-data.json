I'm Leo Vincent, and I focus on utilizing code for creative solutions for unserved issues/needs.\n\nAs a full stack developer, I utilize Javascript, CSS, HTML, and React to develop apps that make others’ lives easier. My unique background as an audio/visual technician gives me the ability to learn quickly; and solve problems while under pressure. As someone who prefers to be multi-talented over hyper focused, I adapt quickly and easily to changes. This and my background gives me a perspective which allows me to see creative solutions that others might not.\n","budget":{"currency":"$","default":10,"max":30,"min":5},"company":"Freelance","focus":"Learning React","focus_url":"https://reactjs.org/","for_hire":true,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/9fdf7184195b649698487dc63a5a63b2/f5587/profile.png","srcSet":"/static/9fdf7184195b649698487dc63a5a63b2/f5587/profile.png 144w,\n/static/9fdf7184195b649698487dc63a5a63b2/b3497/profile.png 288w","sizes":"144px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/9fdf7184195b649698487dc63a5a63b2/7512d/profile.webp 144w,\n/static/9fdf7184195b649698487dc63a5a63b2/654e6/profile.webp 288w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"144px"}]},"width":144,"height":144}},"publicURL":"/static/9fdf7184195b649698487dc63a5a63b2/profile.png"},"initials":"LV","location":"San Francisco, USA","name":"Leo Vincent","profession":"Web Developer","relocation":true,"skills":["JavaScript","HTML / CSS","React"],"tools":["Heroku","VSCode","Github"]},"social":{"nodes":[{"name":"linkedin","url":"https://linkedin.com/in/username"},{"name":"github","url":"https://github.com/username"}]},"history":{"nodes":[{"company":"Freelance","period":"April 2021 - present","position":"Web Developer / Bootcamp Graduate","url":null},{"company":"I.A.T.S.E.
